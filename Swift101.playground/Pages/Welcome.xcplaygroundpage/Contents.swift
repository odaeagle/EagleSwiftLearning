 ## Swift v.s. Objc in Eagle's words
 
 - no more header files

 - higher-order functions
 - simplied import
 - a lot easier to learn!
 - no more ;
 - lots functional language flavour
 
 ## About This Guide
 
 I will walk you through most of the basic stuff of Swift as well as those really nice to know gotchas here and there, the goal of this guide is to give you a quick introduction and enough context to enable you to dive in the future.
 Feel free to use this playground to try/play with Swift, matter of fact I strongly recommend you to do so, I have also provided helper function for you to analyze your code performance
 
 ## About Eagle
 
 Started as an Android engineer in 2011 after graduation from University of Waterloo, built tablet OS/Apps based on Android 2.3 + OpenGL in my first job. Started iOS development couples of years later (rich enough to buy Mac/iPhone). Started Swift/Kotlin around 4.5 years ago and never looked back.
