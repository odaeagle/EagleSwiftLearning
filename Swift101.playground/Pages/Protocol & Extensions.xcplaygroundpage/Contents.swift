# Protocol
 
 WIP ðŸš§
 
 "
 A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.

 In addition to specifying requirements that conforming types must implement, you can extend a protocol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that conforming types can take advantage of.

# Extension
 
 "
 Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you donâ€™t have access to the original source code (known as retroactive modeling). Extensions are similar to categories in Objective-C. (Unlike Objective-C categories, Swift extensions donâ€™t have names.)
 "
 
 Extension is one of my favourite feature from Swift, let me show you couples of interesting example usage of
 extension

 ## Provide additional feature to existing class/struct
 
 following example add a helper method to array of any numeric value

 ## Provide additional constructor to struct
 
 Recall our previous encounter with Struct, Swift will
 automatically generate constructor for your struct, however, if you
 provide your own, the generated one will get replaced by yours, what if
 you want to keep both? Extension!
