 # Control Flow

 "
 Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include while loops to perform a task multiple times; if, guard, and switch statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

 Swift also provides a for-in loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.

 Swiftâ€™s switch statement is considerably more powerful than its counterpart in many C-like languages. Cases can match many different patterns, including interval matches, tuples, and casts to a specific type. Matched values in a switch case can be bound to temporary constants or variables for use within the caseâ€™s body, and complex matching conditions can be expressed with a where clause for each case.

/*:
 ## Guard

 ### The purpose of guard is a compiler-forced exit from the invariant.

 I am sure you have the following code before
 
 ```
 if something == nil {
    return nil
 }
 ```
 
 now you can do
 
 ```
 guard something != nil else {
    return nil
 }
 ```

 You may think, what's the benefit of guard?

 - It's compiler-forced, that means in guard you have to either return or throw.
 - Reducing nesting when testing invariants.
 - It's for better clarity.

 ### Higher-Order functions

 Definition (Will be tested in Final Exam)

 *A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function*
 
 You will find it's less likely for you use old fashion loops in Swift because Swift comes with a fleet of very useful Higher-order functions such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sorted`

let firstEven = arr.first(where: { $0.isMultiple(of: 2) })
let firstEvenIndex = arr.firstIndex(where: { $0.isMultiple(of: 2) })

// You can also invent your own higher-order function (we will cover detail about function/closure later)
// The following function will check if every element in `items` meet certain `condition`
func all<S: Sequence, T>(items: S, condition: (T) -> Bool) -> Bool where S.Element == T {
    items.reduce(true, { $0 && condition($1) })

// Why do we do `$0 && condition($1)`
// Can we write `condition($1) && $0`

// trailing closure can be simplifed as following line
print(all(items: [2: "a", 4: "b", 6: "c"]) { $0.key.isMultiple(of: 2) })

 ### Higher-Order functions Gotcha
 
 Use `lazy` when you want to perform chained operations, by default `map`, `filter` will return
 a new Array, by putting `lazy` we can avoid allocating intermediate memory
 
 If you speak Python3, you may know that by default Python3's `map` `filter` will return a `generator` which is
 very similar in concept
